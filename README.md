# Wiki for Elektron Analog Mk1 OLED replacement displays

There are four known Elektron devices with the same LCD model.

The LCD model is CFAG12232xxxx.
So... I designed an OLED drop-in replacement for it.

The supported Elektron devices are:
+ Analog Four (Mk1),
+ Analog Heat (Mk1),
+ Analog Keys (Mk1),
+ Analog Rytm (Mk1).

To order the OLED upgrade kit, follow instructions [here](order.md)

More info coming ~~soon~~ when I have time for it...
