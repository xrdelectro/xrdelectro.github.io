# Wiki for Elektron Analog Mk1 OLED replacement displays

There are four known Elektron devices with the same LCD model.

The LCD model is CFAG12232xxxx.
So... I designed an OLED drop-in replacement for it.

The supported Elektron devices are:
+ Analog Four (Mk1),
+ Analog Heat (Mk1),
+ Analog Keys (Mk1),
+ Analog Rytm (Mk1).

If you want to get the OLED module, contact me through \[put_here_my_github_username\]@gmail.com


More info coming ~soon~ when I have time for it...
